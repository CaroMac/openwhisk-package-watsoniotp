## Publishing Device Events

The `/watson/iotgw/publishEvent` action publishes events from a registered Watson IoT Platform Gateway, on the behalf of attached devices. The parameters are as follows:

- `text`: The notification message to be shown to the user. For example: `-p text "Hi ,OpenWhisk send a notification"`.
- `url`: An optional URL that can be sent along with the alert. For example: `-p url "https:\\www.w3.ibm.com"`.
- `deviceIds` The list of specified devices. For example: `-p deviceIds "[\"deviceID1\"]"`.
- `platforms` Send notification to the devices of the specified platforms. 'A' for apple (iOS) devices and 'G' for google (Android) devices. For example `-p platforms ["A"]`.
- `userIds` - Send notification to the devices of the specified users. For example: `-p userIds "[\"testUser\"]"`
- `tagNames` Send notification to the devices that have subscribed to any of these tags. For example `-p tagNames "[\"tag1\"]" `.

- `gcmCollapseKey`: This parameter identifies a group of messages
- `gcmCategory` - The category identifier to be used for the interactive push notifications.
- `gcmIcon` - Specify the name of the icon to be displayed for the notification. Make sure the icon is already packaged with the client application.
- `gcmDelayWhileIdle`: When this parameter is set to true, it indicates that the message will not be sent until the device becomes active.
- `gcmSync`: Device group messaging makes it possible for every app instance in a group to reflect the latest messaging state.
- `gcmVisibility`: private/public - Visibility of this notification, which affects how and when the notifications are revealed on a secure locked screen.
- `gcmPayload`: Custom JSON payload that will be sent as part of the notification message. For example: `-p gcmPayload "{\"hi\":\"hello\"}"`
- `gcmPriority`: Sets the priority of the message.
- `gcmSound`: The sound file (on device) that will be attempted to play when the notification arrives on the device.
- `gcmTimeToLive`: This parameter specifies how long (in seconds) the message will be kept in GCM storage if the device is offline.
- `gcmStyleType`: Specifies the type of expandable notifications. The possible values are `bigtext_notification`, `picture_notification`, `inbox_notification`.
- `gcmStyleTitle`: Specifies the title of the notification. The title is displayed when the notification is expanded. Title must be specified for all three expandable notification.
- `gcmStyleUrl`: An URL from which the picture has to be obtained for the notification. Must be specified for `picture_notification`.

- `gcmStyleLines`: An array of strings that is to be displayed in inbox style for `inbox_notification`. Must be specified for `inbox_notification`.
- `gcmLightsLedArgb` - The color of the led. The hardware will do its best approximation.
- `gcmLightsLedOnMs` - The number of milliseconds for the LED to be on while it's flashing. The hardware will do its best approximation.
- `gcmLightsLedOffMs` - The number of milliseconds for the LED to be off while it's flashing. The hardware will do its best approximation.

- `apnsBadge`: The number to display as the badge of the application icon.
- `apnsCategory`: The category identifier to be used for the interactive push notifications.
- `apnsIosActionKey`: The title for the Action key .
- `apnsPayload`: Custom JSON payload that will be sent as part of the notification message.
